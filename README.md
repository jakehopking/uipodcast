## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into the site's directory and fire it up.

    ```shell
    cd uitherapy.fm/
    gatsby develop
    ```

2.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    The ite is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

3.  **See anything that you want to improve?**

    Make the changes and submit a PR, and if I agree with your improvment or added feature, I'll merge in to production.
