## Show notes

In this week's episode I share my thoughts on creativity, intuition and introduce the terms 'Qualitative Design' and 'Quantitative Desgin'.

### Overview

- Welcome subscribers
- Introduce #QuickCuppa format
- Talk about <Link to="/journal/free-stickers">Free Stickers</Link> giveaway, open to everyone!
- Share thoughts on creativity

### Innovation

The following doesn’t necessarily directly apply to UI design, but I think it’s important to keep in mind as I continue through this exploration into creativity.

- Firstly, design can begin with the recognition of societal changes or trends. This involves listening carefully to users’ voices and needs. This can be called ‘demand-driven’ or ‘needs-led’ design.
- Secondly, design can begin with discovery or development in science, technology or the arts. This can be called ‘genesis-driven’ design. Example being a new platform or media type: app design etc.
- Thirdly, design can begin with the generation of a product idea aimed at bridging the gap between demand and genesis.
- These three approaches are not mutually exclusive, and they can and usually are applied in parallel. Both demand and genesis are essential for design, and in actual cases of breakthrough design, the three approaches are often integrated.

### Types of creativity in innovation

- The first type of creativity is the out-of-the-box or outside-the-box creativity that generates ideas which depart from what is believed to be common sense (conventional, preconceived notions or ‘wisdom’). An essential part of this type of creativity lies in successfully eliminating preconceived notions, and breaking down the wall of fixation.
- This term design fixation refers to the designer’s reluctance (or inability, in some cases) to consider multiple strategies to formulate and solve a design need. The design **fixation** phenomenon severely limits creativity and results in pedestrian design solutions. It is essential for designers to move past fixation to realise potential and create remarkable solutions.
- 9 Dots Problem.
- The other type of creativity is demonstrated in a concept of connecting seemingly unrelated ideas, knowledge or technologies. A typical example is the original Macintosh computer, a product of combining graphical user interfaces (GUI), at the time under development at Xerox, within a small form factor. Steve Jobs famously said, ‘Creativity is just connecting things’.

### Quantitative and qualitative design

#### Qualitative vs Quantitative

|           | Qualitative                                                                       | Quantitative                                                                     |

| Data type | Consists descriptions and statements that are measured and expressed subjectively | Consists of objective information that can be measured and expressed numerically |
