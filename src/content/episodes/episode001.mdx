## Show notes

In this first episode I introduce myself, my background and then share what the show’s intended purpose is, who it’s aimed at and why create it. I have a bit of a rant at the JS tooling and package ecosystem. I talk about why I believe that UI designers and developers should be more closely aligned on understanding and appreciation of respective skills and processes etc.

### Overview of the episode

- Who’s it for, and what’s it about?
- Why am I creating this?
- Format/Frequency

### Who’s it for?

- UI designers
- UI developers
- Anyone interested in machine/human interaction

### What’s it about?

- It’s about the technologies, the people, the state of the UI design and development industry.
- UI Therapy name: clarify this (too many frameworks/tooling) it’s a mess and I want to offer help and simplicity here. Barrier to entry in this space. Even for veterans it’s frustrating.
- - How will I do this?
- - By being opinionated.
- - Talking to professionals and experts in their field and sharing their frustrations (so you don’t feel alone).
- - Being uncool and suggesting that where we’re headed might benefit from looking at the past.
- - Covering tools, frameworks, languages, patterns, methodologies
- - Not just the Web. Also about UI (and sometimes UX) in games (upcoming episode interview game designer), smartphones, consoles, apps; basically things with screens.

### Why?

There are plenty of podcasts that are aimed at developers/designers in general and there are also shows about the Web, but ones specifically aimed at UI design AND development as a core focus, the pickings are thin at best.

### Format/Frequency

- Weekly or bi-monthly
- Plan is for interviews, solo diatribes, 'quick cuppa' for short focused content and 'long brew' episodes, where I share case studies or deep dives into topics, tutorials or reviews etc.
