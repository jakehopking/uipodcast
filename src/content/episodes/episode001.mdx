## Show notes

Britain’s world-leading performing arts sector has been brought to its knees and faces ruin without urgent government investment, a powerful alliance of nearly 100 actors, writers, directors and creatives has warned.

Phoebe Waller-Bridge, James McAvoy, Sharon D Clarke, Tom Stoppard, Wendell Pierce, Emma Rice and Andrew Scott are among the names backing a letter warning of the threat facing theatre, opera and dance amid the coronavirus crisis.

In total, 98 creatives who were this year nominated for the nation’s most prestigious stage awards – the Olivier awards and Theatre awards – have called for action to help save a sector they say is needed more than ever.
