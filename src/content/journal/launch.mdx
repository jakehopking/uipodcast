## Launch announcement

Hello fellow UI Developers and Designers - Today my new podcast was listed on Apple Podcasts, so I'm now trying to gain some momentum behind it and hopefully make more than a ripple in the ocean of podcasts.
It‚Äôs been challenging getting to grips with recording setups, and then interviewing, editing and publishing the audio - not to mention the time spent building out this supporting Website for show notes and posts, but it‚Äôs been an exciting journey and I‚Äôm happy (as well as nervous) that it‚Äôs out in the wild for all to hear and critique.

I'd really love some solid feedback regarding the content and also what UI developers and designers such as yourselves would like to hear about on the show itself.

## Vision

The state of user interface design and development is at a crossroads: do we embrace complexity and raise the barrier to entry, or can we learn from the past and strive to make our tools, frameworks and methodologies simpler and more intuitive for everyone - regardless of experience or persuasion. I'm a strong believer in the latter, and if you are too, come join me on my journey to make a difference and push back against the forces of complexity and chaos. Featuring guest interviews; reviews of tooling, frameworks and methodologies; deep-dives and tutorials all related, sometimes tangentially, to UI design and development on the Web, in apps, games and appliances.

I want to feature industry professionals and experts who are striving to make real positive change in the industry. Pioneers of simplicity if you will.

I also want to talk to people who are struggling in the industry; perhaps they are like me - fatigued by the increasing complexity around tooling, frameworks and ideologies; perhaps they are new to this space or are thinking about joining and pursuing a career here - and they are feeling overwhelmed and confused.

I want to let this latter group know that there is simplicity out there, and that there are great people working hard to turn the tide against the status quo.

## Competition

I really need your help to improve the podcast‚Äôs launch success, and by that I mean I would love for the podcast to get into the New & Noteworthy section of Apple Podcasts. Therefore I‚Äôm going to be giving away T-Shirts and Posters, which will obviously be beautifully designed, to 20 people, and also one lucky winner will get to choose the topic and co-host (if so inclined) a future episode.

## Suggestions

I'm keen to hear your suggestions on topics I should cover or guests I can interview who are aligned with my vision outlined above. Perhaps there's a genuinely revolutionary new product, framework or tooling that is absolutely worth showcasing. For example in my <Link to="/episodes/3">episode with Fred K Schott</Link>, we talk about how his new Snowpack 'bundler' is a game changer for developers, and his vision for the Pika CDN can change the way we build JS files too.
I would love to hear your ideas.

[I've created a Google form](https://forms.gle/xAsyENsbhJbYg2wo6) to help organise suggestions, but if you'd prefer to start a coversation then please reach out on Twitter [@uitherapy](https://twitter.com/uitherapy) or [send me an email](mailto:show@uitherapy.fm).

## Thanks
