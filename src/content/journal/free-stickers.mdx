## Four white hart themed UI Therapy stickers!

As I announced in this week's episode <Link to="/episodes/4/">Thoughts on creativity, innovation and intuition in design</Link> I'm giving away four full colour, high quality vinyl stickers for you to adorn whatever it is you want to struce up. This promo is open to **anyone who follows the rules outlined in this post**. Here are a few ideas of where to stick them:

- On your laptop's lid. Original.
- On your favourite mug. Custom mugs FTW.
- On the desk of that colleague who-likes-to-keep-things-complicated in their code.
- On your face mask.
- On your clamshell suitcase. Never offend Mr Yamada-san again by insisting his bag is yours.
- Ok, enough.

## Mocks

Unfortunately the [www.stickershop.co.uk](https://www.stickershop.co.uk) have been a little slow to turn around proofs (they cite C19 which is understandable), and we've needed a couple of iterations, therefore I can't share photos of reality yet. I will update this post as soon as I receive the order. Until then, enjoy the high resolution original designs...

## Thanks

And I look forward to seeing photos of where you stick these lovely stickers. Perhaps I will reserve a special prize for what I think is the best or most audacious attachement?? ü§î
